# Binary Indexed Tree

Binary Indexed Tree, aka Fenwick tree, supports **single-point modification** and **range query** and requires little code.

## Lowbit

> The length of the interval governed by $c[x]$ is specified to be $2^k$.

> $k$ is the index number of bits where the first bit $1$ occurs in the most right.

> $2^k$ is the value represented by the lowest set bit of x. 

For example, $88_{(10)}=01011000_{(2)}$ , its lowest bit $1$ and the following $0$ form the binary $1000$ , which is $8$. Therefore, $c_{88}$ represents the interval information of $a[81 \ldots 88]$.

```cpp
// This trick takes advantage of twoâ€™s complement binary representation. 
// The bitwise AND of x and -x gets the value represented by the lowest set bit of x.
int lowbit(int x) {
    return x & (-x); // 2^k
}
```

## Build 
```cpp
void init() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    t[i] += a[i];
    int j = i + lowbit(i);
    if (j <= n) t[j] += t[i];
  }
}
```
